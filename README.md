# Damask 

Damask is a string annotation library, that supports segmentation, and then annotating those segments with arbitrary metadata.

It is early alpha, untested, use at your own risk.

create a .env file in the root directory of the project
with the following contents:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>
OPENAI_ORG=<your openai organization id>
```

I recommend a venv, and
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Get started with
```
Example.ipynb
```
